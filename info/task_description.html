<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    Jessica is going to see her family overseas today, so she goes
	to the local gift shop to buy some souvenirs. There are <strong>N</strong> souvenirs
	on the shelf, numbered 1, 2, ..., <strong>N</strong> from left to right. Souvenirs come 
	in different types, which are denoted by positive integers. Jessica is 
	in a hurry, so she can take only a consecutive interval of souvenirs. 
	Formally, Jessica selects two indices, <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>, and takes 
	all of the souvenirs numbered <i>l, l+1, ..., r-1, r</i>. Also, due to 
	tax rules, airport security will throw away all souvenirs of a type if 
	Jessica has more than S of that type in the chosen interval.
</p>
<p>
	For example, suppose <strong>S</strong> = 2, and Jessica brings six souvenirs: one of type 0, 
	two of type 1, and three of type 2. She will be allowed to keep the souvenir of type 0 and both 
	souvenirs of type 1, but she will lose all of the souvenirs of type 2!
</p>
<p>
	Jessica needs to choose <i>l</i> and <i>r</i> such that she can take the maximum 
	number of souvenirs for her family. What is the maximum number of souvenirs she can bring?

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> 
	<p>
		Two arguments
		<ul>
			<li>
				list of positive integers, represents types of souvenirs on the shelf from left to right;
			</li>
			<li>
				positive integer, maximum amount of souvenirs of a single type in the chosen interval.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong>
	<p>
		An integer, maximum number of souvenirs Jessica can bring to her family. 
	</p>

<!-- Give some usage examples -->
<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
<pre class="brush: python">
home_coming([1, 1, 4, 1, 4, 4], 2) == 4
home_coming([1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 1) == 6
home_coming([1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3, 4, 1], 1) == 4
</pre>
<p>
	In case #1, Jessica should choose <i>l</i> = 2 and <i>r</i> = 5. This allows her 
	to take 4 souvenirs to the airport of types 1, 4, 1 and 4. None of them are thrown 
	away by airport security, so she is able to bring 4 souvenirs to her family.
</p>
<p>
	In case #2, Jessica should choose <i>l</i> = 1 and <i>r</i> = 8. This allows her 
	to take all 8 souvenirs to the airport. Her souvenirs of type 5 are thrown away 
	since she has more than <strong>S</strong> = 1 of them, so she is able to bring 
	a total of 6 souvenirs to her family.
</p>
<p>
	In case #3, Jessica should choose <i>l</i> = 1 and <i>r</i> = 9. This allows her 
	to take 9 souvenirs to the airport of types 1, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3 and 4. 
	Her souvenirs of type 8 are thrown away since she has more than <strong>S</strong> = 1 
	of them, so she is able to bring a total of 4 souvenirs to her family.
